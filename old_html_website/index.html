    <h1>Christopher Watson</h1>

    <p>My name is Chris Watson and I'm a fourth year Ph.D. student at the University of Pennsylvania,
        where I am very fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/">Rajeev Alur</a> and
        <a href="https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~dineshj/">Dinesh Jayaraman</a>.
    </p>

    <!-- <p>
        I work at the intersection of Robot Learning and Formal Methods.
        I study how human-provided specifications can work synergistically with autonomously discovered task structure
        to scaffold effective learning.
        From the specification side, I am interested in finding specification techniques that are intuitive for a human
        to provide,
        specific enough to ensure the desired learned behavior, and flexible enough to allow the learner (e.g. a robot)
        to customize its approach based on its unique capabilities and experience.
        I believe that a lot of useful task structure is not immediately apparent to humans and must be discovered by
        the robot during learning: I am especially interested in developing approaches to robot learning that
        leverage specified and discovered structure harmoniously.

        I study how human-provided specifications can work synergistically with autonomously discovered task structure
        to scaffold effective learning.
        Ideally, a human would be able to specify a task in a way that is intuitive,
        breaks the desired behavior down into simpler components,
        and is flexible enough to allow the learner (e.g. a robot) to customize its approach based on its unique
        capabilities and experience.

        I work at the intersection of Robot Learning and Formal Methods.
        I study how human-provided and autonomously-discovered task structure can work together to scaffold effective
        learning.
        Ideally, a human would be able to specify a robot's task in a way that is intuitive,
        flexible enough to allow let the robot customize its approach to its unique capabilities,
        and exposes structure within the task to facilitate efficient learning.
        Oftentimes, a lot of the most interesting and useful task structure is not obvious to humans and must be
        discovered by the robot during
        learning.
        My research focus is to develop
        forms of specification that leave room for the robot to add its own learned information,
        learning algorithms that let the robot discover task structure from firsthand experience,
        training methodologies that harmoniously combine both sources of structure.
